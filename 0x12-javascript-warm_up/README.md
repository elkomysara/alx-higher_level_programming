# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm Up
## Background Context
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for various purposes. In this project, you will be working with JavaScript for two main reasons:
1. **Scripting** ‚Äì similar to what you have done with Python.
2. **Web Front-End** ‚Äì this will come later when we make the AirBnB project dynamic using JavaScript and jQuery.

For now, the focus is on basic scripting concepts in JavaScript to build a solid foundation before moving on to web front-end development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without needing any external resources:

### General
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- How to run a JavaScript script.
- How to create variables and constants.
- Differences between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- All data types available in JavaScript.
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements.
- How to use comments in JavaScript.
- How to assign values to variables.
- How to use loops like `while` and `for`.
- How to use `break` and `continue` statements.
- What a function is and how to define and call functions.
- What a function that does not return anything actually returns.
- The scope of variables in JavaScript.
- How to use arithmetic operators.
- How to manipulate dictionaries (objects).
- How to import and export files in JavaScript.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **node (version 14.x)**.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- You are required to have a `README.md` file at the root of your project folder.
- Your code should be **semistandard** compliant (version 16.x.x).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Install Node 14:

$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Install Semi-standard:
```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```
