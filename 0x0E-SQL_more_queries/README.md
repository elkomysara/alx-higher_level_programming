# 0x0E. SQL - More Queries

## Description
This project focuses on more advanced SQL queries and database management techniques. You will learn how to manage MySQL users and their privileges, create databases and tables with constraints, and explore advanced querying techniques such as joins, unions, and subqueries. The project also dives into importing data into a MySQL database and retrieving meaningful information through complex SQL statements.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external references:

- How to create a new MySQL user.
- How to manage privileges for a user to a database or table.
- Whatâ€™s a PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY.
- How to use constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE.
- How to retrieve data from multiple tables in one query.
- What are subqueries and how to use them.
- Different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) and how to use them.
- How to use UNION and other SQL set operations.

## Requirements
- All files are executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0 (version 8.0.25).
- All SQL queries include comments describing the task.
- All SQL keywords are written in uppercase.
- Each file ends with a new line.
- The length of each file is tested using `wc`.

## Project Structure
This project is organized into multiple tasks that progressively build your understanding of advanced SQL concepts. Each task requires creating a `.sql` script to solve a particular problem.

## How to Use

1. Install MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    ```
    Check the version:
    ```bash
    mysql --version
    ```

2. Start the MySQL service:
    ```bash
    sudo service mysql start
    ```

3. Import databases or run scripts by executing:
    ```bash
    mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p < script.sql
    ```

4. Make sure to replace `root` with the correct user and adjust the database names where needed.
