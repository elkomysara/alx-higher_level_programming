# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Description
This project dives deep into Python's object model, emphasizing the fundamental understanding of how variables, references, objects, and memory interact. It covers essential concepts like mutability, immutability, object identity, and the behavior of objects in different scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What objects are in Python
- How Python handles variables, objects, and memory references
- The difference between mutable and immutable types
- How Python implements list objects and handles tuples
- The inner workings of Python's small integers and string interning
- Common pitfalls with object references and identity

## Requirements
- All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Code should follow the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) guidelines.
- The first line of all script files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Files should end with a new line.
- No external libraries or modules should be imported unless otherwise stated.

## Files

### Python Scripts:
1. **19-copy_list.py** - A function that returns a copy of a list.
2. **100-magic_string.py** - A function that returns a string concatenated based on the number of iterations.
3. **101-locked_class.py** - A class `LockedClass` that only allows instantiating a `first_name` attribute, preventing dynamic creation of other attributes.

### Answer Files:
These answer files provide solutions for theoretical questions related to object identity, mutability, and Python's memory model.

- **0-answer.txt** - The function to retrieve the type of an object.
- **1-answer.txt** - The function to get the memory address (variable identifier).
- **2-answer.txt to 28-answer.txt** - Various answers regarding Python's object behavior and memory handling in different scenarios involving integers, lists, and tuples.
  
- **103-line1.txt, 103-line2.txt, 104-line1.txt to 106-line5.txt** - Advanced questions on how Python manages integers and strings in memory, including deletion and small object optimization.

## Usage
The Python scripts can be run directly using:

```bash
./<filename.py>
```

For answer files, refer to the provided questions to understand the context of the answer. Each answer is provided in the required format without additional content.
